# Dynamic Programming Series by Aditya Verma (Python Edition)

Welcome to the Python-based repository where you can find all the code discussed in Aditya Verma's Dynamic Programming tutorial series on YouTube. This series is a valuable resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of dynamic programming through Python, from beginners to seasoned programmers.

## What is Dynamic Programming?
Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is used when the solutions of the same subproblem are needed repeatedly and can be cached for future use. In this repository, all implementations are provided in Python, a language known for its readability and efficiency in algorithmic design.

## Playlist
You can watch the full video series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqowUJzG-iM&list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go).

## Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific problem discussed in the videos. Each folder contains:
- A clear and concise explanation of the problem statement.
- Python source code files with detailed comments explaining the logic behind each solution.
- Additional resources and reading material to further explore each topic.

## Python Environment Setup
To run the Python scripts found in this repository, you should have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Optionally, setting up a virtual environment for Python can help manage dependencies better:
```bash
python -m venv dp-venv
source dp-venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `dp-venv\Scripts\activate`
